# Synopsis
### Our project is based on the paper by Lingle & Clarke, which outlines Earth's response to ice melting and rising sea levels in the West Antarctic Ice Stream. The elastic response is the immediate, short-term deformation of Earth under the ice load. The viscous response is the slower, more long-term effects and adjustments due to the load. This paper is important to understand the feedback mechanisms between ice sheets and the solid Earth, which is increasingly relevant in a time where ice is melting at unprecedented rates. 
### Within this paper, we focus on modeling the partial differential equation that describes the net thickening on the ice sheets central flow line which is given by ∂Hg/∂t = Ag - Vg * ∂Hg/∂x + Hg * εzz. 
### Setting the time range between -16,000 B.P (before present) to now, we aim to plot how thickness has changed relative to time at different points within the West Antarctic Ice Shelf.
